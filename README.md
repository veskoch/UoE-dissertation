# Arrangement of Popular Songs with Deep Learning #

This repository contains the code for the author's dissertation at the MSc Artificial Intelligence program at The University of Edinburgh. -- Summer 2018


### Abstract of Proposed Research ###
The proposed dissertation project is building on the recent momentum in applying deep learning to music-related tasks. Most of the academic and private sector efforts have gone to devise full algorithmic composition of new content imitating the training corpus. However, the present research takes a different approach. The author looks at building a technology which can support rather than supplant the human creator. Over 12 weeks in the summer, the author will have access to a never-before-used dataset from the music industry to design a Recurrent Neural Network- based architecture which can transform simple monotonic melodic cues from popular songs to elaborate compositions backed by chords, taking extreme ranges and varying rhythmically and dynamically â€“ a reconceptualization known in music jargon as arrangement.
